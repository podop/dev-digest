# DevDigest — agent map

Local-first AI PR review. 4 independent packages, **no workspace**: each has its
own `package.json` + lockfile; code is shared via tsconfig path aliases.

| Package | Stack | PM | Port |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server/` | Fastify 5 · Drizzle · Postgres 16 + pgvector · Zod 3 | pnpm | 3001 |
| `client/` | Next.js 15 · React 19 · TanStack Query 5 · next-intl | pnpm | 3000 |
| `reviewer-core/` | pure TS review engine, consumed as source | npm | — |
| `e2e/` | agent-browser (CDP), no LLM | npm | — |

Node 22 (`.nvmrc`) · pnpm 10 (exact version in `packageManager`) · Docker (Postgres only;
API and web run on the host).

## Commands
- Boot everything: `./scripts/dev.sh` (`--no-seed` · `--no-client` · `--db-only`)
- Test / typecheck / lint: run inside the package — see its `AGENTS.md`.
- Lint = Biome, linter only, one root `biome.jsonc` (must stay `.jsonc`: a
  commented `biome.json` is silently ignored). Never run `biome check --write`
  or enable the formatter — it would rewrite the whole repo.
- Shared contracts in sync: `./scripts/check-shared-drift.sh` (also in CI).
- All gates for the changed packages, cached per working-tree state:
  `./scripts/gates.sh` (`--integration` · `--show` · `--state`). Review rounds see only the
  delta: `./scripts/review-delta.sh save r1` / `diff r1`. Orchestration rules that keep
  tokens down: `.claude/agents/README.md` → Token budget.

## Read when
- Change spans packages or you need the big picture → read `README.md` (Architecture)
- Touching the review flow end to end (import → run → findings UI) → read `docs/review-flow.md`
- Writing, moving or splitting tests, or editing CI → read `TESTING.md`
- Editing built-in agent prompts or model choice → read `docs/agent-prompts/README.md`
- Every task, right after the user's request and before planning/editing → read the
  `INSIGHTS.md` of each package it concerns; treat it as high-confidence guidance
  unless told otherwise (skill `engineering-insights`, step READ). Subagents working
  from a plan read its context pack (`docs/plans/<plan>.context.md`, the planner's
  READ output) instead of the whole files

## Per-package layout (convention)
Every package has the same four knowledge slots:
- `README.md` — source of truth (stack, diagrams, API/route maps). Link, don't copy.
- `docs/` — deep dives too long for the README.
- `specs/` — feature specs (what to build and acceptance criteria), one file per feature.
- `INSIGHTS.md` — lessons learned, fixed sections, append-only (skill `engineering-insights`).

## Gotchas
- `@devdigest/shared` exists as **two copies**: `server/src/vendor/shared` and
  `client/src/vendor/shared`, and they already differ. Change a contract → update both.
- `reviewer-core` resolves `@devdigest/shared` from `server/src/vendor/shared`.
- Migrations do **not** run on boot (`cd server && pnpm db:migrate`).
- The course adds features lesson by lesson (see README.md "What you build"):
  missing screens, modules and empty tables are expected, not bugs.

## Do not touch
- Never `docker compose down -v` — it wipes `devdigest_pgdata` (all imported repos).
- `design/` — reference mockup, not source.
- `server/clones/` — runtime checkouts of imported repos.

## Before opening a PR
Run the `pr-self-review` skill (`/pr-self-review`) on the branch: it routes the diff to
the other skills, runs the deterministic gates and answers PASS or BLOCK. It is manual —
nothing invokes it on push.

## On finishing a task
Run `engineering-insights` (WRAP-UP): re-read the touched package's `INSIGHTS.md`,
append only new, verified, non-obvious insights via its script; if nothing qualifies,
write nothing. Never edit existing INSIGHTS.md lines. Do not skip this step.
