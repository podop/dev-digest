/* hooks/keys.ts — the one query-key scheme for every TanStack Query hook.
   Keys are hierarchical, so invalidating a prefix covers its children:
     prKeys.detail(prId)   → the PR itself + its runs, active runs, reviews, comments
     repoKeys.detail(id)   → a repo's pulls list, context files and index state
     skillKeys.detail(id)  → a skill + its versions and stats
   Hooks and mutations reference these factories — never inline key literals. */
