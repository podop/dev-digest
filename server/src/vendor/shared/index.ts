 * Exports (Zod schemas + inferred TS types):
 *  - contracts/findings   Review, Finding, Severity, Verdict, FindingAction, trifecta
 *  - contracts/brief      Intent, BlastRadius, Risks, PrHistory, SmartDiff, PrBrief
 *  - contracts/knowledge  Conformance, EvalRun/EvalCase, MemoryItem,
 *                         Skill/CommunitySkill, ConventionCandidate, Agent
 *  - contracts/trace      RunTrace, RunEvent, RunLogLine (single-document trace)

 *  - contracts/onboarding  OnboardingTour, OnboardingTourState (GET/POST /repos/:id/onboarding)
 *  - adapters             adapter interfaces + ModelInfo
 *  - constants/feature-models  zod-free FEATURE_MODELS registry (re-exported by
 *                         contracts/platform; import the subpath from bundles
 *                         that must stay zod-free)
 *  - constants/skills     zod-free skill limits + name regex (re-exported by
 *                         contracts/knowledge; same subpath rule)
 *  - constants/project-context  zod-free Project Context limits + default glob
 *                         (re-exported by contracts/project-context)
 *  - constants/onboarding  zod-free Onboarding Tour limits + section ids
 *                         (re-exported by contracts/onboarding)
 *
 * Feature agents (A1–A6) and F2 import everything from here. The barrel is
 * stable — feature agents EXTEND with new files, they do not edit existing ones.
