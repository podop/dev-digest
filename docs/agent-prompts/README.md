# Writing agent prompts

How a review agent's `system_prompt` is turned into the messages a model sees, and
the conventions that keep findings, scores, and verdicts consistent.

These are the prompts that drive each reviewer agent (stored on `agents.system_prompt`
in the DB). The canonical, reviewable copies live next to this file:

- [`general-reviewer.md`](./general-reviewer.md)
- [`security-reviewer.md`](./security-reviewer.md)
- [`performance-reviewer.md`](./performance-reviewer.md)
- [`test-quality-reviewer.md`](./test-quality-reviewer.md)

> The DB is the source of truth at run time. These files are the human-readable
> originals — when you change a prompt, edit the file here **and** push it to the
> agent (`PUT /agents/:id`, which versions the change into `agent_versions`).

## How a prompt is assembled

Assembly happens in `reviewer-core/src/prompt.ts` (`assemblePrompt`). The model
receives exactly two messages:

**System message** = your agent prompt **+** a fixed injection guard:

```
<your system_prompt>

<INJECTION_GUARD>   // appended verbatim to EVERY agent, every run
```

`INJECTION_GUARD` (`prompt.ts:16`) tells the model that everything inside
`<untrusted>…</untrusted>` is data, never instructions, and that claims like "test
fixture / not for production / ignore this" never descope the review. You do not
need to repeat any of this in your prompt — it is always there.

**User message** = the task and all context, in this order, each untrusted block
delimiter-wrapped (`prompt.ts:104-122`):

```
<task line, e.g. "Review PR #7 '…'">
## PR description        (untrusted, author-controlled, truncated to 4000 chars)
## PR intent              (server/specs/05-intent-layer.md — see below)
## Skills / rules        (the agent's linked, enabled skills — see below)
## Relevant memory       (curated memory items)
## Repo skeleton         (untrusted, repo-derived)
## Project context       (untrusted spec chunks)
## Callers of changed symbols  (untrusted, repo-derived)
## Diff to review        (untrusted)
```

Sections with no content are omitted. Everything repo- or author-derived is wrapped
in `<untrusted source="…">…</untrusted>` so the model can tell instructions
(system) from data (user).

## Intent: the `## PR intent` section

When the intent layer resolved an intent for this review (server/specs/
05-intent-layer.md), the section is prefixed by a **trusted** rule
(`INTENT_SCOPE_RULE`, `prompt.ts`) that frames it as a derived HINT — never
authoritative, never a limiter on what may be flagged — followed by the
**untrusted**, `wrapUntrusted`-delimited rendering of the intent text, its
change type, its confidence (and an "inferred" note when the confidence is
`low`), and its in-scope / out-of-scope bullets. No intent resolved → the
whole section is omitted, and the prompt is byte-for-byte the same as before
this feature.

**`Finding.out_of_scope`.** The `Finding` schema's `.describe()` asks the model
to set `out_of_scope: true` on a finding that falls outside the intent's
stated in-scope changes — but only when `## PR intent` is actually present.
This is judgment (schema-owned, like `Finding.skill`), not a quota: flagging a
finding this way **never** means omitting it, downgrading its severity, or
softening its rationale — `reviewer-core`'s `applyScopePolicy` (`review/
scope.ts`) enforces that mechanically after the model responds, the same way
`groundFindings` enforces citation grounding. A CRITICAL out-of-scope finding
is still a blocker and still counts in the score.

## Skills: the `## Skills / rules` section

A **skill** is a named, versioned piece of Markdown (a rubric, a house convention, a
security gate) that many agents can share. At run time the executor
(`server/src/modules/reviews/application/run-executor.ts`) loads the agent's
linked skills **in link order**, keeps only the **enabled** ones and renders each
as one block (`modules/skills/domain/skill.ts` → `renderSkillBlock`):

```
### <name>
_Applies when:_ <description>        ← omitted when the description is empty

<body>
```

The blocks are joined with a blank line under `## Skills / rules`. With map-reduce
the section repeats in every chunk. An agent with no enabled skills gets **no**
section — its prompt is byte-for-byte the pre-skills prompt. Skills are
**trusted** text (not `<untrusted>`-wrapped): wrapping them would make the
injection guard tell the model to ignore them. Foreign skills are gated instead —
an imported skill is stored disabled until the user reviews and enables it.

Writing a skill:
- The **description is the interface**: one directive sentence that says *when*
  the rule applies — "Flag … when …". It is what the model reads first.
- The body states what to flag, at which severity (`CRITICAL / WARNING /
  SUGGESTION` — the same vocabulary as the agent prompt) and what **not** to flag.
- No JSON shape, no output format, no finding quotas — same rules as agent prompts.
- Limits: name is a kebab slug (≤ 64 chars, unique per workspace, shown as
  `<name>.md`), description ≤ 300 chars, body ≤ 20 000 chars.

**Attribution (`Finding.skill`).** The `Finding` schema has an optional `skill`
field whose `.describe()` tells the model to put the exact `###` heading name of
the skill a finding enforces, or null. Like every field meaning it lives in the
schema, not in prompt prose — agent prompts need no extra instruction. The server
resolves the name against the run's attached skills (`findings.skill_id`; an
unknown name is kept in `skill_name` only). Skill stats (pull rate, accept rate)
are computed from it, and each run records the exact skill versions it used
(`agent_run_skills`, trace `skills_used`).

## The output schema is NOT in the prompt

This is the most common source of confusion. The structure of the response — the
`{ verdict, summary, score, findings[] }` object and every field type — is enforced
**out of band** by the provider, not by prompt text:

```ts
// reviewer-core/src/llm/openrouter.ts
response_format: { type: 'json_schema', json_schema: { name, schema, strict: true } }
```

The schema is the Zod `Review` contract in
`server/src/vendor/shared/contracts/findings.ts`, converted to JSON Schema and sent
as a separate API parameter. In `strict` mode the model **cannot** return anything
that doesn't match it. Consequences for prompt authors:

- **Do not describe the JSON shape, field names, or a markdown layout in the prompt.**
  It is redundant at best and actively harmful when it disagrees with the schema
  (e.g. a prompt that asks for `### [SEVERITY]` markdown sections while the schema
  demands a JSON object — the model gets two conflicting specs and produces garbage
  in the fields the prompt didn't pin down).
- **Use the schema's own vocabulary.** Severity is exactly `CRITICAL | WARNING |
  SUGGESTION`. Verdict is exactly `request_changes | approve | comment`. Do not
  introduce a different scale ("High/Medium/Low") in the prompt — the model will map
  it onto the enum inconsistently and inflate severities.
- **Field *meaning* belongs in the schema's `.describe()`, field *judgment* belongs
  in the prompt.** The prompt's job is to tell the model *what to flag and at what
  severity*, and *when each verdict applies* — not what the JSON looks like.

## Required conventions (every reviewer prompt)

Every reviewer prompt must end with three blocks, because the engine derives
numbers and gates from what the model returns:

1. **Severity rubric** mapped to the three enum levels, with an explicit
   anti-inflation rule. Only `CRITICAL` blocks merge, so a model that calls
   everything CRITICAL turns every PR into a blocker. State plainly that speculative
   issues ("might be", "if not already handled") are at most `WARNING`.

2. **Verdict semantics.** The model owns `verdict`, so it must be told the mapping:
   `request_changes` ⇔ at least one CRITICAL; `comment` ⇔ only non-blocking
   findings; `approve` ⇔ empty findings list. **No findings ⇒ approve.** Without
   this, models default `verdict` arbitrarily (we have observed `request_changes`
   returned with zero findings and a summary saying "no issues found").

3. **Findings discipline.** No duplicate findings; no padding toward a count. There
   is no minimum or target — zero is a good answer. Models treat "return at most N
   findings" as a quota and pad the list with repeats to hit N, which also corrupts
   the score. State that the count is free and repeats are forbidden.

Output language is not the agent prompt's job: the trusted task line
(`server/src/modules/reviews/domain/prompt.ts` `taskLine`) already requires the
summary and every finding in English, with code quoted verbatim. The system LLM
features pin it the same way (intent classifier, conventions extraction) —
cheap models answer in another language otherwise (seen: Chinese intent text
from `deepseek-v4-flash` on a thin PR).

## How the engine uses the output (why the conventions matter)

`reviewer-core/src/review/run.ts` + `reduce.ts`:

- **`score` is recomputed**, never trusted from the model:
  `scoreFromFindings(grounded)` (`reduce.ts:27`). 0 findings ⇒ 100; each CRITICAL
  −35, WARNING −12, SUGGESTION −3. So the number on screen always matches the
  findings list. The model's self-reported score is ignored.
- **Findings are citation-grounded**: a finding whose line range doesn't intersect a
  real diff hunk is dropped (`grounding.ts`). Cite real `file:line` from the diff or
  the finding disappears.
- **`verdict` is currently passed through from the model** (`run.ts:208`). That is
  why a wrong verdict reaches the UI unchanged — and why the verdict convention
  above is load-bearing until/unless the verdict is also derived deterministically.

## Severity / verdict / gate at a glance

| Model returns | Engine does |
|---|---|
| `findings[].severity` | recompute `score`; count CRITICAL as blockers |
| `score` | **ignored** — recomputed from findings |
| `verdict` | passed through to the review record (shown in the UI) |
| `findings[]` | citation-grounded; ungrounded ones dropped |

The per-agent merge gate (`agents.ciFailOn`, default `critical`) decides when a CI
review **blocks**: it is deterministic from finding severities, independent of the
model's `verdict`. Keep your severities honest and the gate behaves.
